This IRG will elucidate how the diverse physical/material properties observed for
biomolecular condensates arise from constituent molecular interactions, defining
molecular design principles for novel synthetic and biological materials. While cells have
long been known to isolate reactions into membrane-bound compartments (organelles), a newly
appreciated class of organelles has emerged: membraneless, self-assembled, liquidlike,
biomolecular condensates 1-5 . Physiological structures found across cellular environments, these
condensates perform diverse cellular functions including transcription 6 , translation 7 , microtubule
assembly 8 , and RNA transport 9 . Biomolecular condensates appear to assemble via liquid-liquid
phase separation where the component molecules spontaneously demix from the surrounding
compartment 4,6,7,10,11 . Condensates range from liquid-like and short-lived (minutes, in cell division
for example) to extremely long-lived gels (years, in germ cells). Curiously, many of these
disparate condensates are united by an enrichment in proteins containing intrinsically
disordered regions (IDRs, polypeptide segments &gt; 40 amino acids lacking a rigid, folded
structure). Recent work suggests that IDRs tune physical properties of condensates, specify the
components that co-assemble and co-localize essential biological functions, and even create
multiple co-existing immiscible condesnesd phases 2 . Undesirable evolution of these
condensates to solid aggregates is implicated in diseases such as ALS 10 . Importantly,
condensate material properties and hence, functions, can be altered “on the fly” by
enzymatically catalyzed chemical changes (post-translational modifications) to the disordered
proteins with sequence specificity 12 . Driven to assemble from protein and nucleic acid
constituents without membrane encasing machinery, these biomolecular condensates may have
served as the organizing form of primitive biological matter pre-dating cellular life. Looking
ahead, engineered biomolecular condensates offer the potential to solve long standing
problems, for example, dynamic compartmentalization of reactants and catalysts in multi-step
reactions for synthetic biology and chemistry, design of tunable and environmentally responsive
bio-inspired materials, and bioengineered devices of reversible changes in shape and
mechanical strength.
